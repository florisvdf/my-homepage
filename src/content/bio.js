I am a PhD student at the Bioinformatics group of Wageningen University supervised by Dick de Ridder and work closely together with IFF under the co-supervision of Henning Redestig. For many years, I have been fascinated by the complexity and beauty of proteins, and their potential to perform versatile chemistry. I am particularly interested in how we can unlock this potential and create new proteins that can provide more sustainable alternative to existing industrial processes.\n

The focal point of my PhD lies in using optimization algorithms to identify protein variants of existing proteins with improved desired properties. I am currently working on informing machine learning models with physical priors to improve prediction accuracy, and also on uncertainty quantification methods to better navigate the search space of variant sequences.
